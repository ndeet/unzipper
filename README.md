# The Unzipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip and .rar archives or .gz/tar.gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.rar/.tar.gz/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available).
As of version 0.1.0 it also supports creating archives.

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.


## Requirements
PHP 5.3 and newer
(If you still run PHP < 5.6 you should consider updating PHP. These old PHP versions do not get any security updates and your site may be vulnerable.)

## Security
* Don't leave utility on production server. It can easily be used to extract sensitive information (like configuration files with login/password to your database server). Delete it right after usage.
* To prevent unauthorized access to script, it's password-protected. Default login/password is Rainbow/Dash (case-sensitive). Change constants VALID_USER and VALID_PASSWORD to make your own password.

## Usage
* Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
* In Browser type URL to unzipper.php

### Archive unzipper
* Choose .zip, .rar archive or .gz file you want to extract
* (Optional) select an extraction path, defaults to current directory
* Click "Unzip Archive"

### Archive zipper
* (Optional) Set path to zip, defaults to current directory
* Click "Zip Archive"
